# Audio Files

The app requires three audio files to be placed in `app/src/main/res/raw/`:

1. **countdown.mp3** - A beep or tick sound played during the 3-second countdown before each set
2. **whistle.mp3** - A sports whistle sound to signal the start of an active workout set
3. **bell.mp3** - A boxing bell ring sound to signal the end of a workout set

## Current Status

The current placeholder files (empty .mp3 files) are present but will not produce sound. You need to replace them with actual audio files.

You can:
- Record your own audio files
- Use royalty-free sound effects from sites like:
  - freesound.org
